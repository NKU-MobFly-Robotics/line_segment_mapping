Please cite the above papers if you use this repo in your research.

## How to use

This repo has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04. The line segment mapping module is integrated into a 2-D pose graph SLAM system, which uses open karto package as the front-end and g2o solver as the back-end. Please check out [this repo](https://github.com/nkuwenjian/slam_karto_g2o) to install g2o solver.

After installing g2o solver, please create and initialize a ROS workspace. We assume that your workspace is named catkin_ws. Then, run the following commands to clone and build open karto package:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/open_karto.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Please also install glog
```
sudo apt install libgoogle-glog-dev
```

After the above preparation, clone and build this package:
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/NKU-MobFly-Robotics/line_segment_mapping.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Finally, run the following commands to launch Karto SLAM with line segment mapping:
```
$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch line_segment_mapping line_segment_mapping.launch
```

Open a new terminal and play your rosbag:
```
$ rosbag play <rosbagfile> --clock
```
